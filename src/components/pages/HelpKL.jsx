                    UNDP has partnered with the Government of Jharkhand to
                    jointly initiate the NextGenGov ‘Data for Policy’ initiative
                    on Food Systems. The aim is to incorporate anticipatory
                    governance models for future-fit food systems in Jharkhand
                    using data-driven policymaking tools and ecosystem-driven
                    approaches. UNDP is keen on augmenting learning
                    capabilities, increasing the predictive or anticipatory
                    capacity to feed-in to evidence-driven policies in the
                    state, and create radical traceability and transparency
                    across the system from producers to consumers by building
                    provenance documentation around food that can help build
                    trust in the system at the same time nurture sustainable and
                    healthy practices. The goal is to design, develop and
                    demonstrate anticipatory governance models for food systems
                    in Jharkhand using digital public goods and
                    community-centric approaches to strengthen data-driven
                    policy making in the state.{" "}

                    The Food Systems Innovation platform for Jharkhand is
                    envisioned as a Digital Public Good that will strategically
                    feed into data-driven decision making in the state. The
                    platform will have the capability to visualize and analyze
                    high resolution geospatial data (both vector as well as
                    raster layers). The digital platform will curate, integrate
                    and visualise such critical datasets and assets to answer
                    the basic question of - What is growing where? How much is
                    there and the spatial and temporal changes within the state
                    across various indicators relevant to Agriculture and Food
                    Systems. The platform should be able to visualize over time
                    the changes that have happened to the agriculture ecosystem
                    in terms of crop diversity, changes in soil/ground water,
                    tree cover, and other indicators at higher resolution to
                    support policy decisions. Such a synthesis of data and
                    analytics can help identify farms which are doing
                    exceptionally well (Positive Deviance) through which
                    repositories of good practices and indigenous knowledge can
                    be documented. This also helps in identifying farms that are
                    not doing good as per the defined indicators (Negative
                    Deviance). Positive and negative deviance would be
                    particularly interesting to policy makers since they provide
                    valuable intelligence on – which farms are having
                    exceptionally high productivity compared to others? Which
                    farms are most resilient (or most vulnerable) to extreme
                    weather incidents? Such intelligence when combined with
                    farmer-centric ethnographic research on the ground will
                    provide insights and patterns on climate resilient
                    agriculture practices that are already working well on the
                    ground. The combination of data-driven and community-centric
                    approaches when translated into policy insights can generate
                    policy effects for strengthening climate resilient
                    agriculture.
